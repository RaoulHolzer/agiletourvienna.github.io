            <h3>Topics</h3>
            <p>
               Talks or workshops should cover topics from one of the following areas:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>Organization in agile projects or companies</li>
               <li>Technical best practices and useful tools</li>
               <li>Requirements and testing in agile projects</li>
               <li>Economic questions, project performance and business considerations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In particular, we are looking for contributions involving customers and real life case studies (the more state-of-the-art and experimental, the merrier – people who dare to try should be on stage). Please bring your customer or customer project with you.
            </p>
            <h3>Session Formats</h3>
            <p>
               Possible session formats (each 45 minutes) are:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>Classical talk</li>
               <li>Interactive sessions / workshops</li>
               <li>Practitioner report (case studies)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If your proposed session involves longer exercises or a special format, you can also offer a session requiring two 45-minute slots.</p>
            <p>You will also have the opportunity for you to engage in discussion with other attendees in an Open Jam area, where you can post topics and questions that anyone can read and reply to. </p>
